# ts-curric-demo

This is a skeleton structure for other curriculum.

`info.rkt` needs to list the required tech dependencies, or other curriculum dependencies.

`images/` is where you can put all the images specific to this curriculum.

`main.rkt` should provide whatever hooks are necessary to run the curriculum.  The usual convention
is to provide a function `(quests)`
